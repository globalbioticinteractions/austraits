title: 'AusTraits: a curated plant trait database for the Australian flora'
description: AusTraits is a transformative database, containing measurements on the
  traits of Australia's plant taxa, standardised from hundreds of disconnected primary
  sources. While this repository contains the harmonised data, the raw data and code
  used to build the resource are also available on the project's GitHub repository,http://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits.build.
  Further information on the project is available in the associated publication and
  at the project website https://austraits.org.
